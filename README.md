# Hotel-Booking-Cancellatoin-Project


This data set consists of 119,390 observations and holds booking data for a city hotel and a resort hotel in Portugal from 2015 to 2017. It has 32 variables which include reservation and arrival date, length of stay, canceled or not, the number of adults, children, or babies, the number of available parking spaces, how many special guests, companies, and agents pushed the reservation, etc.
There are many aspects considered when choosing a hotel. The main idea is to find the appropriate prediction model for predicting hotel booking cancellations which finds the finest explaining variables for customer cancellations. This Hotel Booking Cancellation model can be useful not only for the vacationer but for the hotels’ owners.
